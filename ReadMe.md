The task was to predict the number of dengue cases each week (in each location) based on environmental variables describing changes in temperature, precipitation, vegetation, using environmental data collected by various U.S. Federal Government agencies from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the U.S. Department of Commerce.

## How to run
